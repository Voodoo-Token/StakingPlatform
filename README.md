## Voodoo Token Staking Platform
Welcome to the official repository for the Voodoo Token Staking Platform, a decentralized peer-to-peer staking application built on PulseChain. This platform allows you to stake your Voodoo (VDO) tokens and earn high-yield rewards in two unique ecosystem tokens: MAGIC and POISON.

## Overview
The Voodoo Staking Platform is designed to add utility and value to the Voodoo Token ecosystem. By staking your VDO tokens, you can earn up to 30% APY in rewards, distributed as MAGIC or POISON tokens. The platform is fully decentralized, accessible to anyone with a PulseChain-compatible wallet (such as MetaMask), and features flexible staking options with no minimum deposit required.

## Key Features
High APY: Earn up to 30% annual percentage yield on your staked Voodoo tokens.

Dual Rewards: Choose between MAGIC (deflationary mechanism) or POISON (reflection mechanism) tokens as your staking rewards.

Multiple Pools: Six different staking pools with varying durations (30, 60, 120 days) and reward rates.

No Minimum Stake: Stake as little as 1 VDO token.

Deflationary Mechanism: Early unstaking burns 20% of your tokens, reducing supply and supporting long-term value.

PulseChain Integration: Fast, low-fee transactions on the PulseChain network.

Community-Driven: Transparent operations, regular audits, and open communication.

## How Staking Works
Connect Wallet: Use MetaMask or another PulseChain-compatible wallet.

Choose Pool: Select from six pools, each with specific durations and reward types.

Stake VDO Tokens: Deposit your tokens into your chosen pool and start earning rewards.

Claim Rewards: Receive MAGIC or POISON tokens as dividends, depending on your pool selection.
